	To do
	~~~~~

	- Read sort order, ignore chars, range separators read from FM settings.




	To test
	~~~~~~~



	Issues to document
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	- If marker is in imported text, then find doesn't work properly, which happens in FM too.
	- Adding/changing markers in demo mode will sometimes not display - only the first 100 are shown.
	- Update speed will decrease as the book size and marker numbers increase
	- The marker page is taken from the beginning of the enclosing paragraph
	- Deleting a marker contained within another (multiple ;'s) will delete all.
	- Demo mode adding and focus is strange due to limit of markers
	- Closing a doc in a book will remove that docs markers from the emDEX window
	- Change marker, press escape, choose yes to make changes will not update emDEX.
	- Changing options from the tooltray will change all open and subsequent windows.
	- Find needs fully formatted string
	- Checking cross-references does an EXACT match on the text following "see" or "see also"
	- Maximum number of items is 5000 for release version, 100 for demo.
	- Maximum number of indents displayed for a marker is 5. If there are more, then only the first 5 are 
          displayed, and clicking on it won't find it.
	- Maximum number of page references for a marker is 400.
	- Maximum number of emDEX windows open at a time is 5.
	- If realtime updating off, markers sometimes cannot be found - need to update first.
	- Sometimes if formatting is invalid (no closing brace), then find won't work - use FM find.
	- Installation will only work with Frame 5.5, 5.5.6, 6.0, and 7.0
